**Learning:** The application is a static site where many pages include heavy images and YouTube iframes. The core logic in `site-logic.js` waits for the `window.load` event, which is delayed by these assets, making the interactive parts (like reviews) feel slow. Rendering reviews also uses `innerHTML` in a loop, causing unnecessary layout thrashes.
**Action:** Move initialization to `DOMContentLoaded` and use `DocumentFragment` with `textContent` for efficient DOM updates.
